He's just a loner, he never says "Hello"
A friend to no one, he's got no place to go
He don't look happy, he looks through furtive eyes
He ain't got nothing, no one to sympathize
Alright now
He hides himself away, his secrets not revealed
As life just passes by, he keeps himself concealed
A solitary man, an enigmatic child
A riddle never solved, a prisoner exiled
Alright now
